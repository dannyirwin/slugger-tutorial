      <h3>Welcome to Slugger!</h3>
      <p>
        This project was built during my first couple weeks with Flatiron School
        as a personal warm up before classes started each day. It is a part of a
        code-along tutorial I wrote to explain the basics of making a browser
        game for beginner coders.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin the game by pressing "P"</li>
        <li>Use "WSAD" or the arrow keys to move the slug</li>
        <li>Run into a snack to eat it</li>
        <li>Avoid running into the edge and yourself</li>
      </ul>
