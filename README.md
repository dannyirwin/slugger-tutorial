# Welcome to SLUGGER!

This project is the repo for a Browser Game for Beginners tutorial written as a
series of blog posts. It was createing during the first couple weeks of a
Software Developer Bootcamp with Flatiron School as a daily side project in the
mornings before classes. Using only vanilla JavaScript, it was built to be a
bare bones example to walk a reader through some basic features. I modeled it
after the game Snake for its endless playability despite its very simple design.
I may add additional features beyond the core learning goals to add polish.

## Getting Started

The slug can be controlled using WSAD and the arrow keys. P will pause and
resume the game. While paused, SpaceBar will progress one game tic.

## Learning Goals

- The basics of how an HTML canvas works
- Creating a stable and flexible animation loop
- Creating, rendering, and controlling game objects
- Interactions between game objects
- Responsive and flexible design

## Features Wishlist

- Slug body shape
- Antenna
- Eating Animation
- Score
- UI for starting and ending games
- Instructional UI
- Music and sound
- Randomization of snack color/sprite
- Variable difficulties regarding game speed and arena size
